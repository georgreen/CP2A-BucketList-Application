# BucketList API
 Create an API for an online Bucket List service using Flask.

```Bucket list``` can also be refered to as ```things/something to do before you die```. It is possibly derived from the English idiom to kick the bucket. It is used as an informal way or as a slang and it is believed that the idiom comes from method of execution such as hanging. The origin of the word remains unclear.

 This link will open up a running version of the project on heroku, a detailed documentation is provided on the site.

### Prerequisites
The application is built using python: flask framework.
>[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a microframework for the Python programming language.


To Install python checkout:
```
https://www.python.org/
```


### Installing
For this section I will assume you have python3 and it's configured on your machine. </br>
Navigate to the folder you cloned and run: </br>

- Install Requirements
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Configure Environment.

```
$ export APP_SETTINGS="default"
$ export DEV_DATABASE="path to your database"
$ export SECRET="Secret Key Here"
```
> Note replace the value for DEV_DATABASE with real database path and SECRET with a strong string value


- Configure database
```
$ python manage.py database init
$ python manage.py database migrate
$ python manage.py database upgrade
```

- Run App
```
$ python manage.py runserver
```
The app should be accessiable via : http://127.0.0.1:5000/
