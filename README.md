# BucketList API
 Create an API for an online Bucket List service using Flask.

```Bucket list``` can also be reffered to as ```things/something to do before you die```. It is possibly derived from the English idiom to kick the bucket. It is used as an informal way or as a slang and it is believed that the idiom comes from method of execution such as hanging. The origin of the word remains unclear.
